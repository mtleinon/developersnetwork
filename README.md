# Developers Network
### Implementation

A MERN full stack social network application implemented as a code along project during "MERN Stack Front To Back" Udemy course.

My implementation differs from the original implementation so that I used function based components with React Hooks instead of class based components. I also added TypeScript to the implementation.

### Run the app
